Also moves turn motors if turn_acts_as_drive (turndrive) is true.\r\n\r\nvoid rstopAll():\r\nStops all motors (stopAll seems to be used by ROBOTC).\r\n\r\nvoid move(int mtr, int value):\r\nMoves the specified motor with the specified value.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n====\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/MarkSill/RobLib/wiki) for usage.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
